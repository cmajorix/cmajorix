- I'm @cmajorix, I'm a bigender programmer with loads of experience in Java who works with some Android devices and homebrew game consoles.
- I'm majoring in CS at Northwestern and hope to have cool things on this Github.
- You can find me on Instagram and Twitter at @cmajorix (how convenient!)
- Probably shouldn't be a concern on Github but all opinions are my own and do not reflect my employers or academic institutions.
